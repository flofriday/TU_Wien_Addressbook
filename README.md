An unofficial Android and iOS App to search [TU Wien](https://www.tuwien.at/en/) employees and students.

![Screenshot](screenshot.png)

[Download](https://github.com/flofriday/TU_Wien_Addressbook/releases/latest) the latest release for Android.

**Warning :** While the data this app displays, comes from an official TU Wien
API, the app itself is not official!

## Features
* Search [TU Wien](https://www.tuwien.at/en/) employees and students wihout opening TISS 
* Filter search results
* Optional login (needed to get student information)
* Dark Mode

## Future Features
Things I should implement, but propably won't.

* Support english
* Indicate if the user is logged in while searching
* Indicate that there are no student information without logging in
* Improve Settings UI

## Build it yourself
1) [Install Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
2) Clone this repository or download it.
3) Connect your phone to your computer.
4) Open the repository in your terminal.
5) For Android run: `flutter build apk --release && flutter install`<br>
For iOS you need to sign the App yourself to use it. Here is a 
[Guide](https://medium.com/front-end-weekly/how-to-test-your-flutter-ios-app-on-your-ios-device-75924bfd75a8) 
on how to do this. 

## Frequently asked Question

### Why is the App in German?
Many of the TISS API responses are in German, so in the spirit of consistency 
I just designed the whole App in German.

### The search results are bad!
I know :pensive:<br>
There is just nothing I can do about it, because the App gets them from the TISS 
API.

### Why is the search so slow?
Again, there is nothing I can do about it as the API response just take a long 
time. However, I figured out, the more specific you are, the faster the 
responses are.

### Where do you get the data from?
Actually, there is an official 
[TISS REST API](https://tiss.tuwien.ac.at/api/dokumentation). While the API is 
public (or semi-public, but I will come back to this later), the documentation 
is not, so you need to be able to login to [TISS](https://tiss.tuwien.ac.at/).

However, if you don't have access to [TISS](https://tiss.tuwien.ac.at/), don't worry as 
many aspects of the API are not documented anyway. For example, there is no 
documentation about what the response json looks like or that you can set 
the language via a query parameter or that you will only receive student
information if you are logged in.

To search people on the API, I use the `/api/person/v22/psuche` endpoint.
Here is a full example:
```
https://tiss.tuwien.ac.at/api/person/v22/psuche?q=Panholz&max_treffer=50
```

Here is a list of all query parameters:
| Name        |  Type | Datatype | Description                                                                                                    |
|-------------|:-----:|---------:|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| q           |  path |   string | Searchterm                                                                                                     |
| intern      | query |     bool | If internal persons(like students) should be included. This only works if you are logged in. Default is false. |
| max_treffer | query |      int | Upper limit of results. Limit is 100, Default is 15.                                                           |
| locale      | query | string   | The language of (some?) fields of the result. It uses 2 letter codes like "de" or "en". Default is ????        |

### How does the app log in, to get student information?
So most sane developers, would design the authentication process of an API with an 
API-token or maybe just let you send the username and password with every 
request. (API-token is the way better solution)

Unfortunately, I couldn't find anything like that, so we will do it like the 
Webinterface with cookies, parsing HTML, parsing URLs, following redirects and 
many more cookies.

Sounds fun? I guarantee you **IT IS NOT**!

#### STEP 0: Requirements
Many requests will set you a cookie, so just save them and if you do a request 
in the future to the same domain just send them with the request.

#### STEP 1: Create a session and collect the AuthState
First start with a `GET` request to 
`https://tiss.tuwien.ac.at/admin/authentifizierung`. The server will answer with
the status 302 (Redirect). Now you follow multiple redirects (like 5 or 6) 
until the server finally answers with 200 (OK).

Now parse the URL on which you finally landed on, because in the URL should be
a query parameter called `AuthState` which we need to save for the next request.

#### STEP 2: Get the first login cookie and parsing HTML
Next, we need to make a `POST` request to 
`https://idp.zid.tuwien.ac.at/simplesaml/module.php/core/loginuserpass.php`.

The data we send with that request is form-encoded and there are the following
fields:
|Name|Content|
|--|--|
| username  | *your TU Wien username*                |
| password  | *your TU Wien password*                |
| totp      | *empty (This field is for Two Factor Authentication*|
| AuthState | *the AuthState we collected in Step 1* |

The server should now respond with HTML. In this HTML is a Form with two hidden
fields: `SAMLResponse` and `RelayState`. You now need to parse the HTML and get
the content of both fields and save them.

#### Step 3: Get the second login cookie
Make a `POST` request to `https://login.tuwien.ac.at/auth/postResponse` with
the following form-encoded data:
|Name|Content|
|--|--|
| SAMLResponse | *the SAMLResponse from Step 2* |
| RelayState   | *the RelayState from Step 2*   |

The server will respond with status 303 (Redirect), save that url.

#### Step 4: Get the final TISS cookie
With `GET` requests follow the redirects until the server responds with 
200 (OK), starting with the location we got at the end of Step 3.

While following these redirects the server will eventually set you cookie called 
`TISS_AUTH`. This is the one you ~wanted~ needed all along. Now, all you have 
to do is make requests to the TISS API and send this cookie with them.
